                                #  Operators in python  #

# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
# In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

print(10 * 5)


# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# Assignment operators
# Comparison operators
# Logical operators
# Identity operators
# Membership operators
# Bitwise operators

## Python Arithmetic Operators
# X+y
# x-y
# x*y
# x/y
# x%y
# x**y
# x//y

## Python Assignment Operators
#Operator       Example        Same as
# =	            x = 5	      x = 5
# +=	        x += 3	      x = x + 3
# -=	        x -= 3	      x = x - 3
# *=	        x *= 3	      x = x * 3   
# /=	        x /= 3	      x = x / 3
# %=	        x %= 3	      x = x % 3
# //=	        x //= 3	      x = x // 3
# **=	        x **= 3	      x = x ** 3
# &=            x &= 3	      x = x & 3
# |=	        x |= 3	      x = x | 3
# ^=	        x ^= 3	      x = x ^ 3
# >>=	        x >>= 3	      x = x >> 3
# <<=	        x <<= 3	      x = x << 3
